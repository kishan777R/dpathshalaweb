Do Not Track.<br/>

Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a
“do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header,
which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT
preference setting. Digital Pathshala does not currently commit to responding to
browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no
common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology
companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
Digital Pathshala takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to

continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
implementation of a standard.<br/><br/>
